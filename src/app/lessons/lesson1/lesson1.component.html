<h3>What is Chinese?</h3>


<div class="content">
<p> There are many languages in China. The most common language is Mandarin, or known in China as Pǔtōnghuà 
  (meaning common dialect). It is based on the Beijing dialect and came into prominence due to government 
  officials using it day to day at the capital Bejing. Bejing is still the capital of China today. Another common Chinese 
  language you may have heard about it Cantonese, which is spoken in Hong Kong, Macau and in much of 
   Guangdong, and Guangxi. HSKHanyu teaches Pǔtōnghuà as it is the most widely spoken Language in China.
    Most people that speak other dialects also speak Pǔtōnghuà .
      Chinese is a tonal language (meaning how you say a word can change it’s meaning and usually does).

<h3>Tones? what are tones?</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>
    There are four tones in Pǔtōnghuà. Think of the tone change in English when asking a question. 
    Thats how every word in Chinese works. A small change in tone can drastically change a meaning.
     For example, a word for ask is Wèn ( 问 ) and the word for kiss is Wěn (吻). Very similar sounds 
     but very different meanings. Don’t let that intimidate you though, over time your ears will 
     become more sensitive to telling tones apart and they will begin to sound like different words. 
     Think about each tone as a place on a musical scale. The first tone is high and flat, 
     almost like a high pitch singing. The second tone starts low and ends about Where the first tone begins. 
     The third tone starts the lowest, dips down, and raises before hitting where the first tone begins. 
     And the fourth tone starts high and ends very low. There is a sort of fifth tone often referred to as no tone.
      It’s basically just a quick sound.

<h3>What is Pinyin?</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>

     Hanyu Pinyin 汉语 拼音 or just pinyin is the romanization system for mandarin. Basically it’s what looks like you can read it.
     On top of the 26 letters that we use, It has 4 diacritics (symbols) that show the tone of the word. The ( ¯ ) symbol represents 
     the first tone. The ( ´ ) symbol represents the second tone. The ( ˇ ) symbol represents the third tone and the ( ` ) symbol represents 
     the fourth tone.
